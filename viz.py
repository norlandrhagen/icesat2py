f1. explore track locations in selected area/time - returns lat/lon/elev? possibly resampled if large. Plots using some interactive library for exploration (folium?). Plot over basemap?
f2. 2nd elevation profiles? along track distance (x), elev(y)
f3. interpolated surface from point cloud?
f4. use l4 gridded products to map raster on surface? w/ DEM's?
